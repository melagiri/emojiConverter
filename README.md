# Emoji to Unicode Converter

A VS Code extension that converts emojis in your code to their Unicode escape sequences. This makes it easier for code formatters to process files containing emoji characters.

## Features

This extension provides commands to convert emoji characters in your code to their equivalent Unicode escape sequences. For example:

- ðŸ’¬ becomes `\u{1F4AC}`
- ðŸ˜Š becomes `\u{1F60A}`
- ðŸš€ becomes `\u{1F680}`

This helps prevent formatting issues in code editors and ensures compatibility with tools and systems that may not properly handle emoji characters.

## Usage

There are two ways to use this extension:

1. **Command Palette**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and search for "Convert Emojis to Unicode Escape Sequences"

2. **Context Menu**: Right-click in the editor and select "Convert Emojis to Unicode Escape Sequences" from the context menu

The extension will scan your current file and replace all emoji characters with their Unicode escape sequence equivalents.
