# Character Format Converter

A VS Code extension that provides conversion between different character formats, including emojis, Unicode escape sequences, HTML entities, and Markdown shortcodes. This makes it easier for code formatters to process files containing special characters and ensures compatibility across different platforms and languages.

## Features

This extension provides commands to convert characters between multiple formats:

1. **Convert emoji characters to Unicode escape sequences**:

   - ðŸ’¬ becomes `\u{1F4AC}`
   - ðŸ˜Š becomes `\u{1F60A}`
   - ðŸš€ becomes `\u{1F680}`

2. **Convert emoji characters to HTML entities**:

   - ðŸ’¬ becomes `&#128172;`
   - ðŸ˜Š becomes `&#128522;`
   - ðŸš€ becomes `&#128640;`

3. **Convert emoji characters to Markdown shortcodes**:

   - ðŸ’¬ becomes `:speech_balloon:`
   - ðŸ˜Š becomes `:blush:`
   - ðŸš€ becomes `:rocket:`

4. **Convert back to emojis** from any of these formats:
   - `\u{1F60A}` becomes ðŸ˜Š
   - `&#128522;` becomes ðŸ˜Š
   - `:blush:` becomes ðŸ˜Š

This bidirectional conversion helps prevent formatting issues in code editors and ensures compatibility with tools and systems that may not properly handle special characters, while also giving you the option to switch back to visual emojis when needed.
