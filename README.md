# Emoji Converter

A VS Code extension that converts between various emoji formats including Unicode escape sequences, HTML entities, and Markdown shortcodes. This makes it easier for code formatters to process files containing emoji characters and ensures compatibility across different platforms and languages.

## Features

This extension provides commands to convert characters between multiple formats:

1. **Convert to Unicode escape sequences** from any format:

   - ðŸ’¬ becomes `\u{1F4AC}`
   - ðŸ˜Š becomes `\u{1F60A}`
   - ðŸš€ becomes `\u{1F680}`
   - `:blush:` becomes `\u{1F60A}`
   - `&#128522;` becomes `\u{1F60A}`

2. **Convert to HTML entities** from any format:

   - ðŸ’¬ becomes `&#128172;`
   - ðŸ˜Š becomes `&#128522;`
   - ðŸš€ becomes `&#128640;`
   - `:blush:` becomes `&#128522;`
   - `\u{1F60A}` becomes `&#128522;`

3. **Convert to Markdown shortcodes** from any format:

   - ðŸ’¬ becomes `:speech_balloon:`
   - ðŸ˜Š becomes `:blush:`
   - ðŸš€ becomes `:rocket:`
   - `\u{1F60A}` becomes `:blush:`
   - `&#128522;` becomes `:blush:`

4. **Convert to emojis** from any format:
   - `\u{1F60A}` becomes ðŸ˜Š
   - `&#128522;` becomes ðŸ˜Š
   - `:blush:` becomes ðŸ˜Š

This multi-directional conversion helps prevent formatting issues in code editors and ensures compatibility with tools and systems that may not properly handle special characters, while also giving you the flexibility to convert between any formats as needed.
