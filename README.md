# Emoji and Unicode Converter

A VS Code extension that provides bidirectional conversion between emojis and their Unicode escape sequences. This makes it easier for code formatters to process files containing emoji characters, and also allows you to convert Unicode escape sequences back to visual emojis.

## Features

This extension provides commands to:

1. **Convert emoji characters to Unicode escape sequences**:

   - ðŸ’¬ becomes `\u{1F4AC}`
   - ðŸ˜Š becomes `\u{1F60A}`
   - ðŸš€ becomes `\u{1F680}`

2. **Convert Unicode escape sequences back to emoji characters**:

   - `\u{1F4AC}` becomes ðŸ’¬
   - `\u{1F60A}` becomes ðŸ˜Š
   - `\u{1F680}` becomes ðŸš€

3. **Toggle between emojis and Unicode escape sequences** with a single command.

This bidirectional conversion helps prevent formatting issues in code editors and ensures compatibility with tools and systems that may not properly handle emoji characters, while also giving you the option to switch back to visual emojis when needed.

## Usage

There are multiple ways to use this extension:

1. **Command Palette**:

   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (or `Cmd+Shift+P` on macOS) and search for:
     - "Convert Emojis to Unicode Escape Sequences"
     - "Convert Unicode Escape Sequences to Emojis"
     - "Toggle Between Emojis and Unicode"

2. **Context Menu**:
   - Right-click in the editor and select from the context menu:
     - "Convert Emojis to Unicode Escape Sequences"
     - "Convert Unicode Escape Sequences to Emojis"
     - "Toggle Between Emojis and Unicode"

The extension will scan your current file and perform the selected conversion.
